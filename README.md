# 🏥 AI Medical Diagnosis Chatbot  
*A Hybrid Rule-Based + Bayesian Probabilistic Healthcare Assistant*

---

## 📖 Project Description

This project is an **AI-powered medical diagnosis chatbot** designed to analyze user-described symptoms and suggest possible medical conditions.  
Unlike basic symptom checkers, this chatbot uses a **hybrid approach**:

1. **Rule-Based Reasoning** – Matches the user's symptoms with known disease-symptom patterns.
2. **Bayesian Probabilistic Inference** – Calculates the *likelihood* of each disease based on symptom co-occurrence and disease prevalence.

The system includes a fully interactive **web UI** that simulates a chatbot consultation experience.

> **⚠ Disclaimer:** This tool is for **educational and informational purposes only.** It is **NOT** a substitute for professional medical diagnosis.
